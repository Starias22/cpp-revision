# C++ operators

C++ provides several operators. The table above list them in their order of priority, from the highest to the lowest.

| Operator | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `::` | Scope resolution |
| `++` `--` | Postfix increment/decrement |
| `()` `[]` `->` `.` | Function call, array subscripting, member access |
| `++` `--` `+` `-` `!` `~` `*` `&` `sizeof` `new` `delete` | Prefix increment/decrement, unary plus/minus, logical not, bitwise not, dereference, address-of, sizeof, dynamic memory allocation and deallocation |
| `.*` `->*` | Pointer-to-member access |
| `*` `/` `%` | Multiplication, division, modulo |
| `+` `-` | Addition, subtraction |
| `<<` `>>` | Bitwise shift left, bitwise shift right |
| `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Relational operators |
| `==` `!=` | Equality operators |
| `&` | Bitwise AND |
| `^` | Bitwise XOR |
| `\|` | Bitwise OR |
| `&&` | Logical AND |
| `\|\|` | Logical OR |
| `?:` | Conditional (ternary) operator |
| `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` `\|=` `^=` | Assignment operators |

These operators can be classified into many types, resumed in the table below.

| Category | Operator | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope resolution | `::` | Resolves scope of a symbol |
| Postfix operators | `++` `--` | Increment or decrement the value of a variable, after returning its value |
| Function and member access | `()` `[]` `->` `.` | Call a function, access an array element, access a member variable or function |
| Prefix operators | `++` `--` `+` `-` `!` `~` `*` `&` `sizeof` `new` `delete` | Increment or decrement the value of a variable, apply unary plus or minus, apply logical not or bitwise not, dereference or get the address of a pointer, determine the size of a type or variable, allocate or deallocate dynamic memory |
| Pointer-to-member access | `.*` `->*` | Access a member of an object pointed to by a pointer-to-member |
| Arithmetic operators | `*` `/` `%` `+` `-` | Multiply, divide, calculate the remainder, add or subtract |
| Bitwise operators | `<<` `>>` `&` `^` `\|` | Bitwise shift left or right, bitwise AND, bitwise XOR, bitwise OR |
| Relational operators | `<` `<=` `>` `>=` | Compare two values and return a Boolean value |
| Equality operators | `==` `!=` | Compare two values for equality and return a Boolean value |
| Logical operators | `&&` `\|\|` | Apply logical AND or logical OR to two Boolean values |
| Conditional operator | `?:` | Choose between two values based on a Boolean condition |
| Assignment operators | `=` `+=` `-=` `*=` `/=` `%=` `<<=` `>>=` `&=` `\|=` `^=` | Assign a value or perform a compound assignment |

## Resume

C++ programming language provide several operators: binary and unary operators, which can we classified into many types depending on their function. There are priority rules to consider while using these operators.
