# Introduction to conditional structures

Conditional structures are available and useful in any programming language. They allow the programmer to perform specific tasks such as print a variable, ask the user to input a value, assign or declare a variable, etc, when or while a condition is satisfied.

We will talk about:

* if statements(simple conditions)
* loops
* jump instructions
* swith statements
